I am an undergraduate researcher at [Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com), headed by Dr. Shishir Kolathaya in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, where I develop AI algorithms to enable Quadrupedal Locomotion on extremely-rugged terrains. My work involves developing algorithms that support a range of Quadrupedal Morphologies and deploying these solutions on hardware. 

I also actively collaborate with [Mr. Anantharaman PN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/), Founder & CEO - [JN Research Labs LLP, Bangalore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jnresearch/), on research projects that utilize Generative AI for advanced tabular representation and analytics, which includes developing solutions for Tabular Q&A and Summarization.

I recently completed by B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal.
