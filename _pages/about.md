I am a researcher at [Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com), headed by [Dr. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com) in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, where I develop AI algorithms to enable Quadrupedal Locomotion on extremely-rugged terrains. My work involves developing algorithms that support a range of Quadrupedal Morphologies and deploying these solutions on hardware. We actively engage with [Improbable AI Lab](https://cap.csail.mit.edu/improbable-ai-lab-lab-tour) headed by [Dr. Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at MIT, on building Learning-based Controllers for our custom Quadruped Robot - Stoch 5. 

I also collaborate with [Mr. Palacode Narayana Iyer Anantharaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/), Founder & CEO - JN Research Labs LLP, Bangalore, on research projects that utilize Generative AI for advanced tabular representation and analytics, which includes developing solutions for Tabular Q&A and Summarization. In my previous internship at JN Research Labs, I have worked on developing Dataset Generation Interfaces for Wheeled robots, particularly for Autonomous Navigation tasks.

I recently completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering(2024) from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal. 

My research interests converge on Language Technologies and Robotics. I am excited in the integration of personality AI with advanced perception, planning, and decision-making in socially aware robots. I am intrigued by how these systems can enhance human-robot interaction and physical intelligence through understanding social cues and adaptive behavior.
