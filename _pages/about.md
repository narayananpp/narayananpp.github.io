I am a **Robotics Masters student at Carnegie Mellon University**, where I work with [Dr. Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) on *behavior foundational models* for wheeled quadruped robots. My research broadly focuses on generalization in robotics and multimodal learning, with the goal of building scalable, data-driven systems that transfer across robots, environments, and tasks.

Previously, I was a researcher at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**, where I collaborated with Dr. Shishir Kolathaya on developing [generalist locomotion policies](https://www.stochlab.com/GRoQ-LoCO/) for quadruped robots, emphasizing robustness across terrains and morphologies. I have also collaborated with [Dr. Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at **MIT** on sim-to-real transfer for quadruped locomotion.

In addition to academic research, I have industry research experience at the intersection of **Large Language Models** and real-world systems. I collaborated with [Mr. Anantharaman P.N.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/), Founder & CEO of JN Research Labs, where I worked on applying [LLM-based agents to complex enterprise data problems](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/103176), particularly in transforming unstructured, domain-specific tabular data into machine-interpretable representations for downstream analytics and decision-making.
