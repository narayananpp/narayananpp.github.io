I am a researcher at [Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com), headed by [Dr. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com) in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, where I develop AI algorithms to enable Quadrupedal Locomotion on extremely-rugged terrains. My work involves developing algorithms that support a range of Quadrupedal Morphologies and deploying these solutions on hardware. We actively engage with [Improbable AI Lab](https://cap.csail.mit.edu/improbable-ai-lab-lab-tour) headed by [Dr. Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at MIT, on building Deep RL-based controllers for our custom quadruped robots. 

I also collaborate with [Mr. Anantharaman Palacode Narayana Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/), Founder & CEO - JN Research Labs, Bangalore, on research projects that utilize Generative AI for advanced tabular representation and analytics, which includes developing solutions for Tabular Q&A and Summarization. During my previous internship at JN Research Labs, I developed a joystick control interface for wheeled robots, focusing on teleoperation and surveillance tasks.

I recently completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering(2024) from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal (MANIT Bhopal). 

My research interests converge on Language Technologies and Robotics. I am excited about Embodied AI and Language-informed Robotics.
