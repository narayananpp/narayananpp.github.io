I am an incoming **MS in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)** student at the **Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University**. My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning, embodied AI, and language-informed robotics, with a focus on building generalizable systems that can rapidly and autonomously acquire diverse skills in the real world.

Previously, I was a researcher at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, where I was affiliated with the [Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com), led by [Dr. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com).

My recent project at IISc, GroQLoCO *(Generalist and Robot-agnostic Quadruped Locomotion Control using Offline Datasets)*, involved developing generalist locomotion frameworks that enable zero-shot transfer across diverse quadruped morphologies and terrains using offline multi-behavior learning. This line of work focuses on Imitation Learning for scalable and morphology-agnostic control.

I have also worked on sim-to-real transfer for quadruped locomotion, designing reinforcement learning-based controllers that generalize across environments and terrains, and deploying them on custom hardware platforms as well as the Unitree Go1 robot.

While at IISc, I collaborated with the [Improbable AI Lab](https://cap.csail.mit.edu/improbable-ai-lab-lab-tour), led by [Dr. Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at MIT, on deep RL-based locomotion research for custom quadrupeds.

I also collaborated with [Mr. Anantharaman PN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/), Founder & CEO of JN Research Labs, Bangalore, on Generative AI for structured data analytics. This included research on tabular Q&A, summarization, and building semantic representations for structured data. During my earlier internship at JN Research Labs, I also developed a joystick-based teleoperation interface for wheeled surveillance robots.

I graduated with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India (NIT Bhopal) in 2024.
