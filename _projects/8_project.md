The goal of this work is to create a general purpose user-interface that helps to acquire labeled datasets for
performing AI tasks such as Autonomous Navigation, by navigating a real world wheeled robot in an
indoor environment. This comprehensive dataset, collected from the robot's sensors and actuators, can be utilized for offline reinforcement learning or supervised learning tasks. 
Our robot is a lab version of a service robot. It is built as a general platform for
experimentation and can be customized for a number of applications.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
