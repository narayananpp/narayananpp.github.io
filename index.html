My work involves developing algorithms that support a range of Quadrupedal Morphologies and deploying these solutions on hardware.</p> <p>I also actively collaborate with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantharamanp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mr. Anantharaman PN</a>, Founder &amp; CEO - JN Research Labs LLP, Bangalore, on research projects that utilize Generative AI for advanced tabular representation and analytics, which includes developing solutions for Tabular Q&amp;A and Summarization. In my previous internship at JN Research Labs, I have worked on developing Dataset Generation Interfaces for Wheeled robots, particularly for Autonomous Navigation tasks.</p> <p>I recently completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering(2024) from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal.</p> <p>My research interests converge on Language Technologies and Robotics. I am excited in the integration of personality AI with advanced perception, planning, and decision-making in socially aware robots. I am intrigued by how these systems can enhance human-robot interaction and physical intelligence through understanding social cues and adaptive behavior.</p> </body></html>
